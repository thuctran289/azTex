{"name":"aztex","tagline":"AZimpler Text editor. ","body":"Project Proposal\r\n================\r\n\r\n### Big Ideas\r\nThe big idea for our project will be to make a program that will emulate\r\nLaTex, only simpler and easier to pick up. The program name will be called aztex.\r\nThe program will take a text file that is in aztex format, and convert it into a\r\nnicely formatted pdf document.\r\nThe minimum viable product for our project is a program that takes a text\r\nfile with minimal formatting and converts it into a professional pdf using the\r\nlatex compiler. \r\nThe following features are highly desired:\r\n\r\n1. Numbered Lists\r\n2. Unordered Lists\r\n3. Headers\r\n4. Links\r\n5. Bold, italic, underline, strike-through\r\n\r\nSome stretch goals that may be pursued are programming our own pdf\r\ncompiler, integrated gui to see how the documents will be formatted, and adding\r\nfurther features like images and such.\r\n\r\n### Learning Goals\r\nShared:\r\n\r\n1. Learn more about parsing documents\r\n2. Learn more about working in project teams\r\n3. Interfacing with other libraries.\r\n\r\nIndividual:\r\nJordan Van Duyne:\r\n\r\n1. Make more in-line comments\r\n2. Test more often\r\n\r\nThuc Tran:\r\n\r\n1. Develop better unit tests.\r\n2. Write more efficient code -> Use less nested for loops.\r\n\r\nIsaac Getto:\r\n\r\n1. Write more tests\r\n2. Organize code better\r\n\r\n### Implementation Plan\r\n1. Find latex compiling library\r\n2. Determine how to simplify LaTeX language\r\na. Develop our own language based off of simplified LaTex\r\n3. Learn how to parse our language\r\n4. Separate projects into components -> i.e. compiling, parsing, processing\r\n5. Develop our own compiler\r\n\r\n\r\n### Project Schedule\r\nWeekly Goals:\r\n\r\n1. Figure out the program architecture (with UML/diagrams)\r\n2. Create our language (unit tests for individual formatting options)\r\n3. Working on parsing text file into intermediate representation.\r\n4. Processing intermediate into LaTex Format\r\n5. Compile the intermediate into a PDF\r\n6. Stretch Goals + Debugging.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Collaboration Plan\r\nOverall plan is to work collaboratively on the program architecture and\r\ndeveloping the simplified language. This is to make sure that we are all on the\r\nsame page for what kind of implementation on which we will be working. After\r\nwhich we will subdivide parts of the parsing, processing, and compiling when we\r\nhave functions and subfunctions that do not interact with each other directly.\r\nThis will let us work in parallel for sections of the project.\r\n\r\n### Risks\r\n\r\n- The project could be more complex than we thought\r\n- Libraries are non-existent or difficult to work with.\r\n- Unexpected lack of free work time.\r\n\r\n###Additional Course Content\r\n- language processing","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
