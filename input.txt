## Lists ##

This is an ordered list:

1. write tokenizer
2. write parser
3. write internal representation
4. **???** asdf
5. profit

You can also use an *unordered list*:

- milk
- ~~one~~ _three_ eggs
- *bread*
- potatos

## Text ##

~~If~~ **when** you make mistakes you can ~~strike through~~ text.

You can event link to your favorite sites, like [aztex](http://github.com/thuc289/azTex).

What happens **now**?

## _Altogether_ ##

We can ~~**mix** it~~  _*all*_ together!



## Equations!!! ##

F = G * (m1 * m2) / r ^ 2

sin(x) = pi

you know that sin(x + 2) = 3 * pi is False
